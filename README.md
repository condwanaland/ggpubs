# ggpubs

ggpubs adds new themes to ggplot2 that are all based around aesthetics you would expect to see in scientific publications. 

UPDATE: ggpubs is currently undergoing redevelopment based off the most recent update of the ggplot2 package. Therefore, ggpubs will not currently work with ggplot2. There should be a working version of ggpubs within a month
